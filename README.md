SUGGESTIONS

1. The project manager's (738), remote work hours are excessive for a sector like marketing, which requires 683 hours a week.  I suggest that a company's marketing and human resources departments work remotely more often while the project manager is present on-site.

2. Social Isolation: Employers should provide enjoyable weekly or monthly events for remote workers to interact with one another. This will give them a platform to exchange ideas that will help the business.

3. Sleep Quality: Employers should establish flexible work schedules for their staff so they may get enough sleep and close early, such as from 7 a.m. to 4 p.m. or 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.
